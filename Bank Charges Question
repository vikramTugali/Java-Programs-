A bank charges a base fee of $10 per month, plus the following check fees for a commercial checking account:

    $.10 each for less than 20 checks

    $.08 each for 20–39 checks

    $.06 each for 40–59 checks

    $.04 each for 60 or more checks

Write a program that asks for the number of checks written for the month. The program should then calculate and display the bank’s service fees for the month.
